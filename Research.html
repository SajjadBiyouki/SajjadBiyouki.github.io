            <p> The thyroid is one of the human glands the diseases of which have spread worldwide.
                The thyroid gland produces hormones whose main function is to balance the metabolism and
                cells activities.  There exists various techniques for thyroid diseases diagnosis; including blood test,
                biopsy, and ultrasound images;
                however, radioisotope imaging is the most recent and sophisticated technique to aid specifying
                thyroid diseases more accurately. To highlight the importance of thyroid disorders, it has been shown that
                roughly 2-3 % of United States population suffer from either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
                This project proposes a data-driven system for diagnosing the most prevalent diseases of thyroid
                (thyroid function disorders and thyroid nodules) based on thyroid radioisotope images.
                In the segmentation part, a novel modified clustering algorithm,
                namely Adaptive Possibilistic Fuzzy C-mean (APFCM), is introduced and applied to segment the
                thyroid radioisotope images.  The PFCM algorithm is the extended method of FCM and PCM whose performance
                relies on several arbitrary parameters. In this regard, this project proposes a new clustering algorithm with
                more adaptivity to develop a reliable system.

            <p> Real-world  supply  chain  management  problems  are  somehow  complex,  whose  optimization  is
                computational expensive due to the uncertainty of its critical decision variables.Simulation
                optimization is commonly applied to determine the optimal variables of the imitated behaviour
                of the complicated systems.Due to the uncertain nature of real-world systems,  it is worthy to take
                account the robustness of resulting solutions. In multi-product supply chain system,
                The uncertainty problem can be addressed by considering the safety stock levels.
                This approach is investigated in this study, proposing an applicable framework to define the decision
                and environmental variables, and evaluate their impact on system performance. The simulation process
                is expensive in terms of resource, time. Therefore, Artificial Neural Network metamodel is employed
                to learn the system indirectly. Consequently, The study proposes a robust ANN metamodel-based simulation
                optimization approach, based on Taguchi view, to optimize a multi-product and multi-objective
                supply chain problem.</p>
